;Here is some info on how to create datatables.
;Basically, you just declare a table and make a pointer to the first value of the table.
;Then add however many points you want (181 in case of the ResetMem)
;The ResetMem loops just goes and stores 0's in all the tables' addresses. 
;To store values, you just keep your values in a temporary values, and ISTORE them into the addresses of the datatables.


ResetMem: ; loop to initialize the table to 0's
	LOADI  DataTable   ; get the table address
	STORE  pointer     ; set the pointer to start of table
	ADDI   180         ; find end of table (181 entries in this case)
	STORE  Temp        ; save end for later
ResetMemLoop:
	LOADI  0
	ISTORE pointer     ; store 0 in to table at pointer address
	LOAD   pointer
	XOR    Temp        ; check against table end address
	JZERO  ResetMemEnd ; if that was end, exit loop
	LOAD   pointer
	ADDI   1           ; otherwise...
	STORE  pointer     ; increment pointer
	JUMP   ResetMemLoop ; do it again
ResetMemEnd:

; At the end, throw these in to declare the pointer and table.

pointer:  DW 0
; This MUST be at the end of memory, or saving in to it will overwrite
; everything after it.
DataTable: DW 0
